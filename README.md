This was a EDA Project using another dataset from Kaggle, the dataset used was a police killings in the US. I used this dataset and to do my EDA I had decided to use Tableau to obtain a basic understanding of the software. I have uploaded the powerpoint version to please download it and open it on your own computer for viewing.
